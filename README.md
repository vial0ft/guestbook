# guestbook

This is my a test project.

Simple Guestbook... a very simple guestbook usually.

Single-page web java application.
I've used:
Spring MVC - for servlets.
Spring JPA + Hibernate - for entities management.
PostgreSQL - for storingsssadsdsad123123123
and a little bit
Bootstrap - for not very ugly design on a page(not )
