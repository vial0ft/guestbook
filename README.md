# guestbook

This is my a test project.

Simple Guestbook... a very simple guestbook actually.

Single-page web java application.
I've used:
Tomcat application server.
Maven - like a build manager.
Spring MVC - for servlets.
Spring JPA + Hibernate - for entities management.
PostgreSQL - for storing.
and a little bit
Bootstrap - for not very ugly design on a page(not help).


Project has been created in NetBeans IDE and it's working (I checked it).  

Intstruction:

After import project on your computer, first of all, make sure you have PostgreSQL and it's working.
Second, probably you haven't database and table in your Postgres.
For creating, you need execute shell script init_db.sh in directory src/main/resources/scripts.

And then you can build this project.

If there aren't any errors try to run it in browser.
